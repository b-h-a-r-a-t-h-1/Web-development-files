            <p> The limitations of analytical methods have led
                the engineers to evolve graphical methods. numerical methods can be derived which are more <span>
                    accurate</span>
                with the advent of high speed digital computers and increasing demand for numerical answers to various
                problems.
                Numerical approach enables solution of a complex problem with a great number (but) of very <span>simple
                    operations</span>
                . The major advantage of numerical methods over analytical methods is that they are <span> easily
                    implementable</span>
                with modern day computers and provide solutions in quick time as compared to analytical
                methods.

                        In this method,the unknowns are eliminated successively and the system is

                        In this method the initial approximation for solving the equations are
                        values of variables are zero.,i.e for linear equation with
                        three variable(x,y,z) are <i>x=y=z=0.</i>

                        iteration is continued till the values of variables in previous iteration
                        and current iteration are approximately equal

                        iteration is continued till the values of variables in previous iteration

                It is used to solve eigen value problems .in some applications,
